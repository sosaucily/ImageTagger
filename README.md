ImageTagger
===========

HTML5 image tagging module
This serves up images from a JSON list that need to be tagged.
The interface provides a system for clicking on a section of an image, and specifying the following information:
 - What person, product, concept is being identified
 - Supporting meta words
 - a URL for that person or item
Upon submission, a new image is delivered dynamically, without a page load.
